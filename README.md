# Introduction
This repository includes program codes from the consumer choice study on rice consumption in Senegal conducted by the Bureau d’analyses macro-économiques (BAME) of the Senegalese Institute of Agricultural Research (ISRA), through the STAAARS+ program at Cornell University.

## Study Description
In Senegal food consumption is still dominated by cereals. However, it presents many changes linked to strong urbanization, but also to the transformation of basic products to facilitate their integration into the daily menu of households. Added to this are policies advocating for local products, undertaken by the State in order to reduce the bill of food imports. Indeed, the country displays an extroverted demand with imports of goods and services estimated at 2 977.5 billion FCFA in 2016 (ANSD, 2016). Knowing the structure of this demand for food would better guide public policies in their choice of reducing imports. However, in Senegal, very few studies have focused on the structure of demand for food.

The objective of this research is to analyze the demand for food products in rural and urban areas in Senegal. Particular emphasis will be placed on rice, which is the most widely consumed cereal in the country. To do this, our study will rely on the most recent nationwide household surveys measuring total food consumption in Senegal. This will distinguish it from many other studies essentially based on food availability to assess consumption trends.

## Primary Data
This study relies on a total sample of 7930 households from two different surveys (urban and rural), collected as part of the PAPA1 program, in Senegal. The consumers’ dataset is composed of 2,250 urban households located in 19 major Senegalese cities collected in 2017 and 4,680 rural households collected in 2017 (for horticultural households in the Niayes and Senegal River Valley) and in 2018 (for the other (rainfed) areas).
